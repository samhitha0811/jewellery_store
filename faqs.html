          <p style="color: orange;">2.Is all jewellery hallmarked?</p>
          Gold objects weighing less than 2 grams such as a ring may not be hallmarked. 
          Kundan/polki jewellery are also excluded from the BIS hallmarking programme.
          In such cases, jewellers must include a description of the jewellery as well as the fact that it is not hallmarked on the invoice.
          BIS announced in a notification dated April 4, 2022, that the second phase of mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery and artefacts will begin on 
          June 1, 2022, with 32 more districts added and all gold jewellery items, regardless of caratage, required to be hallmarked.
          On the jewellery invoice it has to be specified whether it is hallmarked or not.

         <p style="color: orange;">3.Do you work with clients diamonds/gemstones?</p>
          No.<br>
          <p style="color: orange;">4.Where can you check the purity of gold?</p>
          “Consumers can also check the authenticity and purity of hallmarked gold jewellery items with HUID numbers by utilising the 'verify HUID' feature in 
          the BIS CARE app, which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store,” says Chainani.
          Individuals can also get their hallmarked jewellery examined for purity via an  Assaying & Hallmarking (A&H)  centre after paying a testing fee of Rs 
          200. 
          “The list of BIS-approved A&H centres can be found on the BIS website at www.bis.gov.in under the hallmarking category,” says Chainani.
      <br>
      <p style="color: orange;">5.How do I clean and care for my jewellery?</p>
          Most jewellery except corals and pearls (since they are organic) are cleaned by dipping them into a bath of lukewarm baby shampoo water, and 
          cleaned with a soft-bristled toothbrush. The jewellery is then wiped dry with a soft towel which does not tug at the metal settings of the gemstones.<br>
